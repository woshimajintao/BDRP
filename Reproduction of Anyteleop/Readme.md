## System Architecture:

The most important part of AnyTeleop is the Teleoperation Server.So I also drew this architecture as Figure show.

## Key Functions :

• Hand Pose Detection:

– Processes visual data captured by the Camera Driver to estimate the 3D hand
pose of the human operator.

– Uses advanced algorithms to track joint angles, fingertip positions, and overall
hand configuration in real time.

• Multi-Camera Fusion:

– If multiple cameras are used, the server fuses input data to enhance tracking
accuracy and minimize occlusion effects.

– Aligns and calibrates inputs from different viewpoints for a comprehensive un-
derstanding of hand movements.

• Hand Pose Retargeting:

– Translates human hand movements into corresponding robotic hand motions
through kinematic optimization.

– Maps the human hand’s degrees of freedom (DOF) to the robot hand’s spe-
cific kinematics, ensuring compatibility while respecting the robotic hardware’s
constraints.

• Motion Command Generation:

– Generates collision-free and smooth motion trajectories for both the robotic
arm and hand using algorithms such as Riemannian Motion Policies (RMPs).

– Ensures safe and stable teleoperation by dynamically adapting to environmental
constraints.
