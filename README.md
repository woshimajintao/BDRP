# BDRP
## Work Timeline
During the past months. I firstly got familiar with some simulation tools and succefully
reproduced AnyTeleop and attempted data collection; however, teleoperation proved to
be an engineer-intensive task with strong hardware dependencies. After discussion with
my supervisor Guillaume, I focused on a smaller aspect—hand detection—by comparing
the performance of two object detection models.
